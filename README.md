# Broken Page Reports

In this repository we keep track of all reports of websites that fail when Ghostery is installed.

We try to keep breakage low, but sometimes adblocking rules conflict with recent changes
that a website did. Often it will be quickly fixed in the community block lists that Ghostery
also uses, but sometimes breakage needs manual fixing from our side.

## Can I report a broken site?

Yes, please do! But maybe there is already an existing ticket that you can find by searching
through our [issues here](https://github.com/ghostery/broken-page-reports/issues)?
[This board](https://github.com/orgs/ghostery/projects/24/views/1) also provides an
overview of our open issues and about their individual state.

If you can find an existing one, feel free to vote on (by giving thumbs up), so we
can better understand in which order we should fix them.

If you cannot find an existing report, feel free to create a new one yourself.
Sometimes it is obvious to see how a website breaks, but it helps us if you can describe the problem,
for instance:

    1. Which website did you visit? What URL should we use for testing?
    2. What happens if you open the page with Ghostery? What does not work?
    3. What would you have instead expected to happen? How should it look?
    3. Does the problem only happen after you interact with the site? If so, what are the steps to reproduce?

Often, screenshots are great to communicate what breaks on a page.

## Should I report bugs here as well?

It is best to keep the reports here limited to concrete examples where an individual websites breaks.
If you instead found a general problem or bug in Ghostery, please let us know through, for instance:

- Open a ticket on https://github.com/ghostery/ghostery-extension/
- Through our website: https://www.ghostery.com/support
- Write us at support@ghostery

Thank you for helping us understand what we need to fix to make Ghostery better!
